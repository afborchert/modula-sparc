Ulm Modula-2 System:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Modula-2 and the origins of our family of Modula-2 compilers have been
designed and developed at the Department of Computer Science, ETH
Zurich in Switzerland (see http://www.inf.ethz.ch) by Niklaus Wirth
and his team.

In December 1981, we licensed the sources of the M2M compiler (4-pass
compiler for the famous Lilith machine) and derived new compilers from
it for the Concurrent 3200 architecture, the m68k processor and the
SPARCv8 architecture. All these compilers conform to PIM3 (Niklaus
Wirth, Programming in Modula-2, 3rd Edition, Springer-Verlag) but not
yet to the ISO standard which finished recently.  The compiler is
accompanied by a moderate number of library modules (which likewise do
not conform to ISO yet), and some tools.

We have now an agreement with the ETH Zurich that the sources which
have been derived from the M2M-compiler may be freely redistributed
provided that

    all derived sources clearly state that Modula-2 has been designed
    and developed at the Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich in
    Switzerland

All sources with the exception of the library (subdirectory src/lib) of
this distribution may be freely redistributed if you follow the above
term for the ETH-derived sources (each of them is clearly marked as
such) *and* the terms of the GNU General Public License, Version 2 (as
found in the file COPYING).

The sources of the library (subdirectory src/lib) may be freely
redistributed under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License, Version 2 (as found in the file COPYING.LIB).
Note that the MathLib module has been derived from the GNU library
(distributed under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License)
which in turn has been derived from sources which have been developed
at the University of California, Berkeley:
This product includes software developed by the University of
California, Berkeley and its contributors.

Supported Platforms:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This distribution supports all platforms which conform to SPARCv8 and run
Solaris 2.x (we have tested it for 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, 8, 9,
and 10). Note that nearly all SPARCs sold by Sun conform to SPARCv8 but
there may be some ancient unsupported platforms (i.e. SPARCv7 and older).

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Manual pages are included. HTML-variants of the manual pages may be
found at

   http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/modula/

and if you want to have a local copy of this tree under

   ftp://ftp.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/pub/soft/modula/ulm/sun4/htmldoc.tar.gz

In addition to the man pages the web tree contains additional
documentation of the compiler and the associated tools.

Portability
~~~~~~~~~~~
Similar Modula-2 systems are available for Sun3, Nixdorf Targon/31 and
Concurrent Computer 3200 Series.
