     _S_y_s_L_o_c_a_t_i_o_n exports  a  set  of  special  locations  in  the
     address  space  of the current process which are initialized
     by the runtime start and to be treated as read-only:


          _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_E_n_d    designates the end of the  program  image
                        during  loading  and  equals  the initial
                        position of the break (see  _S_y_s_B_r_e_a_k_(_3_)).
          _E_t_e_x_t         points  to  the beginning of the initial­
                        ized data segment.
          _E_d_a_t_a         points to the beginning of the  bss  seg­
                        ment (global variables in Modula-2).
          _B_r_e_a_k         is  the  current  position  of  the break
                        which is maintained  by  _S_y_s_B_r_e_a_k_(_3_)  and
                        _S_t_o_r_a_g_e_(_3_)
          _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t   points   to  the  environment  parameters
                        which are  better  accessed  by  _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_­
                        _m_e_n_t_(_3_).
