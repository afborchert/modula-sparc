     The  _E_t_c_G_r_o_u_p  module  can  be used to scan entries of files
     that have a structure as described in _g_r_o_u_p_(_4_) into a  _G_r_e_n_t
     type record.
     Within  _G_r_e_n_t_,  the _m_e_m_b_e_r_s field is a (possibly empty) NNIILL-
     terminated list of users allowed in the group.

     Between _O_p_e_n_G_r and _C_l_o_s_e_G_r_, any (using _G_e_t_G_r_e_n_t) or the next
     entry whose gid cf. grname field matches _g_i_d cf.  _g_r_n (using
     _G_e_t_G_r_g_i_d cf.  _G_e_t_G_r_n_a_m) that has not yet been read  will  be
     written into the _g_r_e_n_t record.
     At  end  of  file, the _G_e_t_X_X_X functions return FFAALLSSEE and the
     data in _g_r_e_n_t is not valid.
     _R_e_o_p_e_n_G_r restarts reading the file from the  top  if  it  is
     seekable, otherwise reports an error.

     Opening  the file "/etc/group", searching for a single group
     ID cf. group name and closing the file  again,  can  all  be
     done at once using _F_e_t_c_h_G_r_g_i_d cf.  _F_e_t_c_h_G_r_n_a_m_.  This is use­
     ful for mapping numerical group IDs to  group  names,  e.g.,
     which is the main purpose of this module.
