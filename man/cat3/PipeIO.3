     _P_o_p_e_n  creates  a  pipe  between the calling process and the
     command to be executed.  _C_m_d is a string containing a  shell
     command  line,  _m_o_d_e specifies the I/O mode, either _r_e_a_d for
     reading or _w_r_i_t_e for writing, _b_u_f_f_e_r_e_d flags if  the  stream
     has  to  be  buffered.  The resulting stream pointer will be
     returned in _f.

     A stream opened by _P_o_p_e_n should be closed by  _P_c_l_o_s_e,  which
     waits for the associated process to terminate.
