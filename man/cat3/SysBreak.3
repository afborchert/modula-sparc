     The memory area between the end of the data segment upto the
     break is used as  heap.   By  moving  the  break  to  higher
     addresses the heap may be extended.

     _B_r_e_a_k  sets the break to the given absolute address.  _S_b_r_e_a_k
     advances the break by _i_n_c_r and returns the current value  of
     the break.

     Note that neither _B_r_e_a_k nor _S_b_r_e_a_k should be called directly
     except by _S_t_o_r_a_g_e_(_3_).

     Both operations may fail due  to  insufficient  memory.   In
     this  case,  FFAALLSSEE  is returned by BBrreeaakk, and _S_b_r_e_a_k returns
     the old break value.  Additionally, _E_r_r_n_o_._e_r_r_n_o is set.
