DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The  _P_a_s_s_w_d module can be used to scan entries of files that
     have a structure as described in _p_a_s_s_w_d_(_4_) into a _P_w_e_n_t type
     record.

     Between _O_p_e_n_P_w and _C_l_o_s_e_P_w_, any (using _G_e_t_P_w_e_n_t) or the next
     entry whose uid cf. logname  field  matches  _u_i_d  cf.   _l_o_g_n
     (using  _G_e_t_P_w_u_i_d  cf.   _G_e_t_P_w_n_a_m) that has not yet been read
     will be written into the _p_w_e_n_t record.
     At end of file, the _G_e_t_X_X_X functions return  FFAALLSSEE  and  the
     data in _p_w_e_n_t is not valid.
     _R_e_o_p_e_n_P_w  restarts  reading  the  file from the top if it is
     seekable, otherwise reports an error.

     Opening the file "/etc/passwd", searching for a  single  uid
     cf.  logname  and closing the file again, can all be done at
     once using _F_e_t_c_h_P_w_u_i_d cf.  _F_e_t_c_h_P_w_n_a_m.  This is  useful  for
     mapping numerical user IDs to names, e.g., which is the main
     purpose of this module.

     All BBOOOOLLEEAANN functions  return  TTRRUUEE  on  success,  otherwise
