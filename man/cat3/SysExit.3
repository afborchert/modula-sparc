DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The  call  of _E_x_i_t causes the process to terminate with exit
     code _e_r_r_o_r_C_o_d_e.  An _e_r_r_o_r_C_o_d_e of 0 indicates  success.   All
     other  codes  are  interpreted as failure by command shells.
     _E_n_t_e_r_C_l_e_a_n_u_p causes _p to be  called  on  exiting.   Multiple
     calls of _E_n_t_e_r_C_l_e_a_n_u_p are possible.  In this case _E_x_i_t calls
     the cleanup procedures in reverse order  (LIFO).   Recursive
     calls  of  _E_x_i_t  (by  cleanup procedures) cause _E_x_i_t to exit
     immediately.

     On return of the main  module  body,  _E_x_i_t  is  called  with
     _e_r_r_o_r_C_o_d_e 0.  _E_x_i_t is not called on run time error aborts.
