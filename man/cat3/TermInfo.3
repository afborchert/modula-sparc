     _T_e_r_m_I_n_f_o allows to access the terminfo database as described
     in _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o_(_4_).  The routines are similar  to  the  terminfo
     level  routines of _c_u_r_s_e_s_(_3_x_) but no output is generated nor
     any _i_o_c_t_l-calls are done.  This allows _T_e_r_m_I_n_f_o to work  for
     more than one terminal at a time.

     _S_e_t_u_p_T_e_r_m  looks  for  a  terminal description for _t_n_a_m_e (an
     empty string causes the environment  parameter  TTEERRMM  to  be
     taken).   On  success  _t_i_n_f_o is filled and TTRRUUEE is returned.
     Failures result from unknown terminals or corrupted terminfo
     database entries.

     The  type  _T_e_r_m is generated from _/_u_s_r_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_t_e_r_m_._h.  Each
     component name starts with an upper case letter.  Underlines
     followed  by  lower  case letters are replaced by upper case
     (e.g. _c_u_r_s_o_r___a_d_d_r_e_s_s becomes  _C_u_r_s_o_r_A_d_d_r_e_s_s).   Capabilities
     are of three different types: _S_t_r_i_n_g (fixed length character
     array), IINNTTEEGGEERR, and BBOOOOLLEEAANN.  Capabilities  in  _T_e_r_m  which
     are not defined in the database are set accordingly to empty
     strings, -1, and FFAALLSSEE.

     _T_p_a_r_m_, _T_p_a_r_m_1_, _._._.  are used to decode  the  capability  _f_m_t
     and  to instantiate the parameters into _o_u_t.  Delay informa­
     tion still remains in _o_u_t.  These routines abort with a mes­
     sage  on _S_t_d_I_O_._s_t_d_e_r_r on errors in _f_m_t or on too few parame­
     ters.

     _T_p_u_t_s prints _s_t_r using _o_u_t_c and interprets the delay  infor­
     mation  which  sometimes  depends  on  the  number  of lines
     affected _a_f_f_c_n_t (give 1 if  not  applicable).   Because  the

     baud-rate  is not known no padding will be done.  Instead, a
     busy-loop with system calls (resolution see  _C_l_o_c_k_._U_n_i_t_s_P_e_r_­
     _S_e_c_o_n_d) does the work.

     _T_p_u_t_s_D_e_l_a_y  works like _T_p_u_t_s but calls _d_e_l_a_y if delay infor­
     mations are found.  The delay time is given in tenth of mil­
     liseconds.
