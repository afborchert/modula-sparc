     _A_r_c_t_a_n  returns  the  arc tangent of _x in the range -pi/2 to
     pi/2.

     _E_x_p returns the exponential function of _x.

     _L_n returns the natural logarithm of _x.

     _S_i_n and _c_o_s return trigonometric functions of  radian  argu­
     ments.

     _S_q_r_t returns the square root of _x.

     The routines may return NNaaNN (not-a-number) in case of domain
     errors or plus or minus infinity if the result value  cannot
     be  represented  as  RREEAALL.   Note  that  NNaaNNs  can be easily
     checked for by  testing  for  equality  on  itself  (returns
     FFAALLSSEE),  and  plus infinity is larger than MMAAXX(RREEAALL).  These
     checks, however, are not portable to platforms which do  not
     conform to IEEE 754.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A similar module named _M_a_t_h_L_i_b_0 was written by Niklaus Wirth
     for the Lilith system.

     The current  implementation  has  been  derived  by  Andreas
     Borchert  from  the GNU C Library which itself has been par­
     tially derived from sources of the Regents of the University
     of  California.   The only exception is _s_q_r_t which is imple­
     mented on base of SSYYSSTTEEMM..SSQQRRTT.
