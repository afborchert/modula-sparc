     _S_y_s_C_o_n_f allows to retrieve some of the configuration parame­
     ters of the local installation.

     _G_e_t_L_i_b_D_i_r  returns the directory where the Modula-2 compiler
     and the library have been installed to.  Note that _G_e_t_L_i_b_D_i_r
     does  not  honour the MMOODDLLIIBB environment variable.  Instead,
     it gives a reasonable default which should be taken if  MMOODD­­
     LLIIBB is not given.

     _G_e_t_R_e_l_e_a_s_e  returns  a  short  string  which  specifies  the
     release of the local Modula-2 installation.

FFIILLEESS
     The local library directory might be  _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_l_i_b_/_m_o_d_u_l_a.

     Note  that  these  procedures return the parameters from the
     system on which your program has been compiled.   Your  pro­
     gram,  however,  may be run on quite a different system with
     another installation if  any.   For  this  reason,  programs
     which  depend on _S_y_s_C_o_n_f should be rebuild if they are to be
     installed on other systems with different parameters.
