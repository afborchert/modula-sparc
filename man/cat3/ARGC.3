     These  procedures  belong  to  the  standard  procedures and
     needn't to be imported.

     _A_R_G_C returns the number of  command  line  arguments  (incl.
     command name).

     _A_R_G_V  stores  a  single  command  line argument addressed by
     _a_r_g_i_n_d_e_x (ranging from 0 to ARGC()-1) into _b_u_f_f_e_r.

     Note that these procedures  are  inherently  inportable  and
     that _A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s_(_3_) should be used instead.

BBUUGGSS
     AARRGGCC and AARRGGVV should have been put into SSYYSSTTEEMM.
