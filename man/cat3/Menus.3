     _M_e_n_u_s  is  based on _W_i_n_d_o_w_s_(_3_) and allows to create and exe­
     cute menus.  A menu with headline _t_i_t_l_e is  created  calling
     _C_r_e_a_t_e_M_e_n_u.   The  headline  may  be  empty.   The resulting
     parameter _m_e_n_u is used as  reference  on  subsequent  calls.
     _D_i_s_p_o_s_e_M_e_n_u releases the space allocated with it.

     A  menu  is  constructed  line  by  line  by  calling either
     _A_d_d_S_u_b_M_e_n_u, _A_d_d_P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e, or _A_d_d_C_o_m_m_a_n_d.   The  text  to  be
     printed on the menu line is given in _c_m_d.  _A_d_d_S_u_b_M_e_n_u allows
     the construction of hierarchical menus.  The parameter  _s_u_b_­
     _m_e_n_u must be initialized previously by _C_r_e_a_t_e_M_e_n_u but is not
     necessarily complete.  So,  recursive  menus  are  possible.
     _A_d_d_P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e  causes  _c_m_d_p_r_o_c to be called if the associated
     menu line is selected.  After having called _c_m_d_p_r_o_c the user
     returns  to  the menu point selected previously.  _A_d_d_C_o_m_m_a_n_d
     causes on selection the complete menu  hierarchy  to  disap­
     pear.   The  parameter _c_m_d_n_o is then returned in _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d of
     _E_x_e_c_M_e_n_u_.

     _E_x_e_c_M_e_n_u creates a window using _N_e_w_W_i_n_d_o_w  (see  _W_i_n_d_o_w_s_(_3_))
     which  fits  into  _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d.  The window is boxed and con­
     sists of the underlined header line and the lines defined by
     _A_d_d_S_u_b_M_e_n_u,  _A_d_d_P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e,  and _A_d_d_C_o_m_m_a_n_d.  The location of
     the upper left corner depends on  the  current  position  in
     _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d.  The size of the window depends on the number of

     menu lines and the maximum width of the _c_m_d  parameters  and
     the  headline.   If  the  number  of lines does not fit into
     _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d only a part of the menu is displayed, but  scroll
     commands  and  a scroll bar enable quick access to the other
     parts.  _E_x_e_c_M_e_n_u returns when the menu is left,  or  a  menu
     line  created  by  _A_d_d_C_o_m_m_a_n_d  is  selected.   The resulting
     parameter _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d equals 0 if the menu is left.   The  menu
     must  not  be  changed during running _E_x_e_c_M_e_n_u by the proce­
     dures given to _A_d_d_P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e_.  But it is possible  to  append
     further menu lines when _E_x_e_c_M_e_n_u returns.  If calls of _E_x_e_c_­
     _M_e_n_u are  nested  (due  to  calls  of  procedures  given  to
     _A_d_d_P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e)  redisplays  (on  return  of  such procedures)
     affect the innermost menu hierarchy only.

     Menu selection is done by function keys:  _u_p  and  _d_o_w_n  for
     movement,  _r_i_g_h_t  for  selection,  and  _l_e_f_t for leaving the
     menu.  Alternatively the _v_i_(_1_) movement commands ('h',  'j',
     'k',  and  'l') and the return key for menu selection can be
     used.  The _v_i_(_1_) commands for fast movement can be  used  on
     menus with scroll bar as follows:
