     _R_e_a_l_R_e_a_l converts a sequence of characters that is generated
     by _R_e_a_d into a real number that is stored into _x.  The char­
     acter sequence is expected to conform to following syntax:

     ["+" | "-"] digit { digit } ["." digit { digit } ]
     ["E" ["+" | "-"] digit [digit] ]

     The  last  character  returned  by  _R_e_a_d will be stored into
     _t_e_r_m_C_H.  _R_e_a_d is expected to return 00CC in case of errors  or
     end of input.

     _W_r_i_t_e_F_l_o_a_t  and  _W_r_i_t_e_F_i_x convert _x into an array of charac­
     ters that is returned in _f.  Valid bases are 8, 10, and  16.
     The  number  of decimal places after the dot is specified by
     _d_p.  _W_r_i_t_e_F_l_o_a_t uses a normalized  exponent  notation  while
     _W_r_i_t_e_F_i_x  suppresses  the  exponent which may result in very
     long result strings  for  very  large  or  small  arguments.
     _W_r_i_t_e_F_i_x adjusts _d_p if necessary.
