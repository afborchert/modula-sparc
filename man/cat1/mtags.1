     _M_t_a_g_s  makes  a  tags file for _e_x_(_1_) from the specified Mod­
     ula-2 sources.  Note that either program modules and  imple­
     mentation modules should be given or just definition modules
     to avoid name clashes.  A tags file gives the  locations  of
     specified  objects  (in  this case procedures) in a group of
     files.  Each line of the tags file  contains  the  procedure
     name,  the  file in which it is defined, and a scanning pat­
     tern used to find the procedure definition.  These are given
     in separate fields on the line, separated by blanks or tabs.
     Using the _t_a_g_s file, _e_x can  quickly  find  these  procedure
     definitions.

     _M_t_a_g_s issues warnings if equally-named procedures are found.
     In this case they may be find only by giving a  fully-quali­
     fied  name  which  includes all enclosing modules and proce­
     dures.
