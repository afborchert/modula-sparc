     _M_2_b  is a beautifier (i.e., formator) for Modula-2 programs.
     _M_2_b accepts the revised Modula-2 grammar.   _I_n_f_i_l_e  (default
     standard  input) is formatted and stored in _o_u_t_f_i_l_e (default
     standard output).  The arguments are interpreted as follows:

     --cc   the  following  argument  defines  where  comments  are
          aligned (default 40).

     --hh   requests the header to be printed.

     --ll   the following argument defines the  approximate  output
          line  length  (default 80); zero length means no limit.
          Comments are not shortened.

     --pp   requests parameter lists to be piled.

     --ss   the  following  argument  defines   indentation   width
          (default 3).

     --vv   requests variable declarations to be piled.

     The  options  can  also be set from within a Modula-2 source
     using a comment as follows:

     (*%p+;c40*)
          requests parameter lists to be piled and sets the  com­
          ment  column at 40.  Blanks are not permitted, `%' sig­
          nals the controlling comment,  and  `;'  joins  several
          options.   All  command  line  options are supported in
          this fashion.

     (*%-*)
          turns formating off. Subsequent text is passed  through
          as is until `%+' is found.

     %+   turns  formating back on.  Modula-2 syntax and formator
          operation must be nested properly.

     _M_2_b can be used as a filter.
