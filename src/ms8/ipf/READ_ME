Ulm's Modula-2 Compiler is internally a 4-pass compiler for program
and implementation modules and a 3-pass compiler for definition modules:

Source ---> Pass1 (lexical analysis, syntax checking,
                   loading of symbol files)
              |
              |
              V
            Pass2 (analysis of declarations)
              |
              +-----> reference file
              |
  definitions |           modules
        +-----+--------------+
        |                    |
        V                    V
      Pass3                Pass3 (analysis of statements)
   symbol file               |
                             |
                             |
                             V
                           Pass4 (code generation)
                             |
                             V
                        assembler text

Each pass of the compiler which is followed by another pass generates
an interpass file. The EBNF grammars of these interpass files are
to be found in this directory:

   12      generated by pass 1, read by pass 2
   23      generated by pass 2, read by pass 3
   34      generated by pass 3, read by pass 4
   leo     line numbers, error codes, and options which may be found
           anywhere in 12, 23, and 34

Note that all symbols are defined in MCBase.

Other files generated by the compiler:

   4e      error file of pass 4 (rarely generated)
   s1      symbol files (will be read by the 1st pass)
   2r      reference file (generated by the 2nd pass)
